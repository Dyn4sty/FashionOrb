- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - a popular user interface JavaScript library
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) - centralize and manage the state of JavaScript apps
- [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/) - helps to navigate through React components
- [reselect](https://github.com/reduxjs/reselect#motivation-for-memoized-selectors) - a "selector" library for Redux, to avoid recalculations of states by using memoized selectors
- [redux persist](https://github.com/rt2zz/redux-persist) - manage to persist redux store in storage
- [react-stripe-checkout](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-stripe-checkout) - a React component the wraps Stripe checkout JavaScript for a better React integration
- [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/) - CSS in JS concept, allow developers style their components by using JavaScript
- [redux-thunk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux-thunk) - Redux Thunk middleware allows you to write action creators that return a function instead of an action
- [redux-saga](https://redux-saga.js.org/) - a library that aims to make application side effects(i.e. asynchronous things like data fetching and impure things like accessing the browser cache) easiter to manage
- [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) - Enable function component to use state and other React features
- [React.lazy](https://reactjs.org/docs/code-splitting.html) - split React component into different chunks, then lazy load them
- [React.memo](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#reactmemo) - If your function component renders the same result given the same props, you can wrap it in a call to React.memo for a performance boost in some cases by memoizing the result
